# character-sheet

Character Sheet is a full stack web application that acts like a Dungeon and Dragons 5e character sheet. 


HTML, Javascript, CSS, Angular, Node, MongoDB, Bootstrap


# Current State
Currently only user creation, character creation, and the stats sheet portion of a character have been completed.
This project has been abandoned. While it might be picked up in the future I have no intention of doing so currently.
